Setup
---

The pedal is a USB HID device, and the kernel's hiddev driver will claim it and
present it as a hiddev device (for example, /dev/usb/hiddev0). By defualt on
Ubuntu system, udev does not create the device with permissions allowing
reading by non-root users. So you need to add a new udev rule to allow
userspace programs to read from the hiddev device.

Included is a udev rule file called pedal.udev-rules. Copy it to your distro's
udev rule directory with a name that will cause it to be read after the udev
defaults. In Ubuntu, I copy it to '/etc/udev/rules.d/51-pedal.rules'.  This
should work for Debian as well.

Usage
---

Currently there is one application that makes use of the driver, pedal_mplayer.
This program takes any arguments given and sends them to mplayer. The left,
middle, and right pedals cause mplayer to rewind, pause/play, and fast-forward,
respectively. The limitation is that mplayer does not take input from the
console while being controlled by the pedal.

Suggested mplayer arguments for transcribing:

    pedal_mplayer -af scaletempo=scale=0.6 file.mp3

To start mplayer at a specific point, use -ss

    pedal_mplayer -ss 10:00 file.mp3
